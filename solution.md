# Linear Programming Problem Explanation
This document explains how the linear programming (LP) problem is solved step by step, using the provided coefficients and constraints.

## 1. Objective Function
The objective function is defined as follows:

\[Z = 1x_1 + 4x_2 + 2x_3\]\nThe coefficients of the objective function are [1, 4, 2].

## 2. Constraints
The constraints are defined as follows:

Constraint 1: 5x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 ≤ 145

Constraint 2: 4x_1 + 8x_2 + -8x_3 ≤ 260

Constraint 3: 1x_1 + 1x_2 + 4x_3 ≤ 190

These constraints define the feasible region of the solution.
## 3. Candidate Solution Validation
We check if the candidate solution satisfies the constraints.
The candidate solution Q = [0, 52.5, 20] is feasible for the primal problem.

## 4. Primal Problem Formulation and Solution
We formulate the primal problem and solve it using the Pulp library.
The primal problem is:

Maximize or Minimize Z = 1x_1 + 4x_2 + 2x_3
Subject to: [5, 2, 2] ≤ 145
Subject to: [4, 8, -8] ≤ 260
Subject to: [1, 1, 4] ≤ 190
Primal Solution: {'x1': 0.0, 'x2': 52.5, 'x3': 20.0}
Primal Objective Value: 250.0
## 5. Dual Problem Formulation and Solution
We formulate the dual problem based on the primal problem.
Dual Solution: {'y1': 1.5, 'y2': 0.125, 'y3': 0.0}
Dual Objective Value: 250.0
## 6. Checking Optimality
The candidate solution Q = [0, 52.5, 20] is optimal for the primal problem.

### Conclusion
The problem has been solved, and the optimal solution has been found or validated.
